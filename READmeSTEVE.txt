Hello Steve,

I wanted to write a short explanation about my project.

From the start, I was trying to follow my UI design, and some decisions I made based on it, I now regret. Because of this, I made my code too complicated, and by the time I realized that, it was too late to start from scratch.

All the required features from the assignment are completed on the search, cart, rented, and view screens. The only functional element on my home screen is the search form, which moves users to the search screen with search results.

I have completed all requirements, and afterward, I wanted to add some simple functions to fetch features like "top 10" or "recommended for you" movies. I added these features, but my addToCart button started conflicting with my cart card button. Due to time constraints, I ended up removing these additional features.

In conclusion, I tried to follow my UI design, maintain good UX logic, and complete all functional requirements, which proved to be too ambitious for my current level of knowledge and experience.

The main lesson I learned from this project is the importance of focusing on the core requirements first. I now understand that I shouldn't overestimate myself and try to implement too many features at once. It would have been better to perfect the essential functionality before adding extra features.

Best regards,
Peter
